            <h1><u>Kalaripayattu</u></h1>
            <p>
                Kalaripayattu (IPA: [kɐɭɐɾip:ɐjɐt:ɨ̆]; also known simply as Kalari) is an Indian martial art that originated in modern-day Kerala, a state on the southwestern coast of India.[5][6][7] Kalaripayattu is known for its long-standing history within Indian martial arts, and is one of the oldest surviving martial arts in India.[8][9]

Kalaripayattu is mentioned in the Vadakkan Pattukal, a collection of ballads written about the Chekavar of the Malabar region of Kerala. In the Vadakkan Pattukal, it is stated that the cardinal principle of Kalaripayattu was that knowledge of the art be used to further worthy causes, and not for the advancement of one's own selfish interests.[10] Kalaripayattu is a martial art designed for the ancient battlefield (the word "Kalari" meaning "battlefield"), with weapons and combative techniques that are unique to Kerala.

Like most Indian martial arts, Kalaripayattu contains rituals and philosophies inspired by Hinduism.[11] The art also bases medical treatments upon concepts found in the ancient Indian medical text, the Ayurveda.[5][9] Practitioners of Kalaripayattu possess intricate knowledge of pressure points on the human body and healing techniques that incorporate the knowledge of Ayurveda and Yoga.[12] Kalaripayattu is taught in accordance with the Indian guru-shishya system.[13] Kalaripayattu differs from many other martial arts systems in the world in that weapon based techniques are taught first, and barehanded techniques are taught last.[14][13]
